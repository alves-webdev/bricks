# Bricks AI - Landing Page Generator

Bricks AI is an open-source project that helps you generate beautiful landing pages using AI technology. Built with Next.js, it streamlines the process of creating professional landing pages for your projects.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Setting up Gemini API

To use Bricks AI, you'll need to set up your Gemini API key:

1. Visit the [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) to get your API key
2. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root
3. Add your Gemini API key:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
